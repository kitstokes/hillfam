Recollection written by Elizabeth Colleta Zervas Hill,"Transcription of text: 'I don't remember exactly, but it seems to me the family home was on 9th St. in Sheboygan. My folks built it from a dowry that my mother had. It was their house for 20 years. They came to Portland, Oregon in 1912; Amanda was 19. My father was ill with asthma. He had been working in a ______ factory in Sheboygan since he came to America at the age of 21. He and two cousins came together in steerage. he said it was almost intolerable, like animals, but that was all they could afford. He was sent to Wisconsin we think because he was a steam engineer. The two cousins went to Florida. No contact was ever made after they parted.'
